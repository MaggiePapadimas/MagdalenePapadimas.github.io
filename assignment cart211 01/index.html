    <div style="text-align:center"><h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="text-color">
      <p>Over the past years I have grown as an artists through schooling, and personal projects. Art has always been my passion. I have always found it easiest to express myself through it, whether through drawing, 3D sculpting, or writing. I decided to pursue an art education related to video games after graduating from high school. At College Inter-Dec, we were taught the basics of game design, 3D
    modeling, Photoshop, texturing, animation, environment and character design.
        </p>

        <p>Through the Computation Arts program, I want to expand and enhance my knowledge, as well as learn new skills that I feel are important in my art career such as programming, robotics, video and sound, as well as the traditional art skills like hand sculpting, and painting. Throughout my learning experience, I have always made sure the viewer was able to understand and see the emotion in my art. I would always integrate these emotions not only in my sketches, but in my 3D art as well. I am a hardworking, team oriented individual who enjoys improving, and learning all that I can to create a great work of art. I believe the Computational Arts program will enrichen this knowledge and also teach me how to work with programming, physical objects, and sound which I am ready and willing to learn.
         </p>

        <p>I have chosen to apply to Concordia University to pursue a bachelor degree for Computation Arts due to the university’s reputation in art, and comforting atmosphere. I am eager and excited to continue building upon my skill as an artist. I believe Concordia University will give me the opportunity to succeed in my academic and career goals which include; exploring new
    fundamental and interesting techniques to integrate physical computations, and having an open mind to envision and perceive the world of art differently. I believe Concordia University’s Computation Arts program will head me in the right direction to my goals. I can’t wait to see what this program has in store for me, and how it will permanently affect the way I work.
